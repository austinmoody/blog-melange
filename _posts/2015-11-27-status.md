I hesitate to call this a *failed* attempt at getting back into blogging, but I think that clearly it is.  I sort of remember having these grand plans at the end of last year about what this would be.  Examples of code I was working on, Quantified Self type update posts from everything I have been tracking, the occasional random *whatever*-type post.  

I started out sort of strong but quickly faded.  A think a lot of it honestly was the setup of the blog.  I had rigged together this way of creating posts from my iPhone but still it was a pain.  I had to be somewhere that I had jekyll installed to generate the pages.  Besides my work computer (which I'm not going to use for personal things) I haven't had steady access to a laptop.  

The weekly updates were sort of neat to setup, but again it required access to a laptop running Ruby and required manual intervention.  So I got too far behind to care.

What about next year?  Still thinking about it.  Probably going to have to go with something *off the shelf* and not try to setup something clever.

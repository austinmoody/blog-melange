## Reading

* Started Fields of Blood by [Karen Armstrong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Armstrong)
* Started [Not That Kind Of Girl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_That_Kind_of_Girl) by Lena Dunham

## Things I Watched 

* Maron season 2 [episode 6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Maron_episodes)
* [The Trip To Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trip_to_Italy) &rarr; Well I attempted to at least. The humor wasn't for me. Was like nails on a chalkboard. 
* [The One I Love](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_I_Love_(film)) &rarr; This is probably the best movie I've watched in quite a while. 

## Apps

* [Moment](https://inthemoment.io) &rarr; Application that tracks how long you use your iPhone (or iPad if that is your thing). I'm interested to see where I land. My *guess* is I use my phone 40 hours a week. Curious to see if I'm way over or under that.

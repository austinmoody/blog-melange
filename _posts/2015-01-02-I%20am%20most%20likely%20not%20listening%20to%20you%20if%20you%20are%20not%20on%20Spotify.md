At the end of each year I try to drum up a list of my favorite albums released in that year.  [Sometimes I do it publicly](http://austinmocephus.blogspot.com/2009/12/austin-2009-music-awards.html), sometimes it's just something jotted down in a notebook somewhere.  

I'm struck how the process of reviewing all of the new things that I've taken in during the year has changed.  In a past life this happened by looking at a stack of physical CD's that had been released during the year that I kept separate.  Over time this morphed into looking at iTunes to see music that I added in the year (that was released during that year).

Now, for better or worse, I look at Spotify (mostly... I've started getting back into vinyl so that plays a part too).  For the last couple of years I have been a very heavy Spotify user.  

Just a week ago I posted my *list* for 2014, which you can view by clicking &rarr; [this](http://notaustintexas.tumblr.com/post/106006498510/music-in-2014) &larr;.  I went through Spotify playlists that I'd created for the year and vinyl records I'd bought to make that list.  And then I sat on it for a few days to make sure I wasn't forgetting anything.  Finally satisfied that I was not I unleashed it onto Tumblr and all 1 or 2 people who actually follow me there.  

Then a couple days ago, for some odd reason, I started up iTunes on my slow 2003 Macbook and saw it.  

[Tomorrow's Modern Boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrow%27s_Modern_Boxes) by Thom Yorke.

This was an album that came out of nowhere, that was released via BitTorrent that I think I paid about $5 for.  I'm a huge fan of Radiohead, and generally and eagerly consume anything that they put out and this attitude expands out to Thom Yorke as well.  I loved his first solo album [The Eraser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eraser) and greatly enjoyed the [Atoms for Peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoms_for_Peace_(band)) record that came out a couple of years ago.  

So when I read about *Tomorrow's Modern Boxes* coming out I bought it immediately.  Moved it into iTunes and gave it a couple of spins and then just forgot about it.

Why?

Because it isn't available for listening on Spotify.

I work from home, and at a very small stand-up desk[^fn1] so the only computer at my disposal is my work laptop[^fn2].  To listen to music I use my iPhone, laying on the desk next to my keyboard playing via Bluetooth through a speaker across the room.  All this to say, that iTunes on my personal Mac is not readily available.  And even if it was that Mac is over a decade old now and really struggles to do anything.  Sure, I could have moved *Tomorrow's Modern Boxes* to my iPhone and played it that way (and I have been over the last few days now that I've re-discovered it) but that was just an extra step.

I guess what I'm saying is that I've grown to love the ability to crank up Spotify and have nearly ever single song I'd ever want to hear ready for me to listen to it.  No downloading and adding to iTunes and transferring to my phone, etc... It's just *there*.  

And I get why musicians hate Spotify and its ilk.  A couple of years ago Thom Yorke himself called Spotify the "[the last desperate fart of a dying corpse](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/07/spotify-thom-yorke-dying-corpse)".  Famously in 2014, [Taylor Swift pulled her music](http://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-explains-why-she-left-spotify-2014-11) off Spotify and other streaming services.

I totally understand their reasons, I just wish there was a way to have a *Spotify* but also make the musicians happy.  The convenience factor is too great to ignore, but I'm just not sure how you make it fair to everyone.

As far as Thom Yorke and Radiohead go.  I love them, so whenever their music comes out I'll get it by whatever means they ask me to get it.  But will I listen to it as much as I have in the past?  If this past year is any indication I might not.  But more than that I worry about the music I'm not hearing at all because it isn't on Spotify because either the artist hates Spotify and/or their label[^fn3] does.  Like I said I'll seek out the Radiohead stuff because I know them already and love them.  But is my next Radiohead out there somewhere?  Out there assuming and hoping that I'll find them on BitTorrent or Bandcamp or Facebook because they are butthurt by Spotify.  Who knows.

[^fn1]: Actually my standup desk is just an old chest of drawers with a stack of books to bring the screen to eye level. 

[^fn2]: Corporate networks being what they are, I'm not testing the waters by loading Spotify or iTunes or anything on my work laptop.  

[^fn3]: Nothing from [Drag City](http://www.dragcity.com) records is available on Spotify. Which sucks for me because there is **a lot** of music on Drag City that I love. I haven't tracked down any reliable statements from them yet on streaming services.

This week I finished reading *[This Is How You Lose Her](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_How_You_Lose_Her)* by Junot Diaz.

I was at first skeptical of this book because I thought it had to be overhyped.  However I loved it and plowed through it fairly quick.  As quick as I could since I had to stop quite a bit to look up spanish phrases.

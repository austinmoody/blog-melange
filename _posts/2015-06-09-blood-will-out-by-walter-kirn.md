![Blood Will Out by Walter Kirn](http://austinmoody.org/i/melange_blood_2015-06-09-105052.png)

I love true crime books but this is the first one that I have read in quite some time.  This is also the first book by [Walter Kirn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Kirn) that I've read.  I love his style.  And the story was gripping.

Above you see chart, which I grabbed from [Twitter Analytics](https://analytics.twitter.com), that shows what happens when a very popular techie person on Twitter retweets you.

That person is Marco Arment ([@marcoarment](http://twitter.com/marcoarment)), who helped created [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com) then created [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com) and now [Overcast](https://overcast.fm).  I have 161 followers on Twitter.  Marco has almost 79,000 followers.

Marco was posting about how he'd been sick quite a bit lately, presumably because of colds brought home by his son from pre-school.  Then he posted this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Fortunately, the kid gets over it in about 4 days, max, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffanyarment">@tiffanyarment</a> seems nearly immune to all child-borne diseases.</p>&mdash; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/564236197518913538">February 8, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To which I responded:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment">@marcoarment</a> Your wife is probably drinking butter coffee when you aren’t looking. It’s the only explanation.</p>&mdash; Austin Moody (@notaustintexas) <a href="https://twitter.com/notaustintexas/status/564238353558962176">February 8, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm not going to go way into why I made this joke, but you can read [this](http://www.marco.org/2013/02/12/buttered-coffee) and [this](http://paleodrama.tumblr.com/post/43050098591/more-dave-asprey-drama-marco-arment-founder-of) for the backstory.

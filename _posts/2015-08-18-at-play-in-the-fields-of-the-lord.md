[At Play In The Fields Of The Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Play_in_the_Fields_of_the_Lord_%28novel%29) by [Peter Matthiessen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Matthiessen).

I picked up an original edition of this in a local bookstore for $5.  Not my favorite Matthiessen book, I started losing interest towards the end.  But still worth the time.

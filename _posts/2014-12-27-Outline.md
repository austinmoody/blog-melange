Today I finished reading [Outline](http://us.macmillan.com/mobile/book/9780374228347) by [Rachel Cusk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Cusk) (as serialized by The Paris Review this year).

This was the first thing I have read by Rachel Cusk. I'm the end I'm a fan. For whatever reason I did not take to it at first but went back and read the first part published by The Paris Review again and it got me.

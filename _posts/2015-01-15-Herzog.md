![Herzog by Saul Bellow](http://austinmoody.org/i/melange_herZog_2015-01-15-201921.png)

I wanted so much to love [this book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_(novel)).  I really did.  It was one that I've wanted to ready for quite some time and recently found a nice, old copy.

The thing is that I just didn't love it.  This book, in places, contains some of the most beautiful sentences I've read.  But overall I just could not get into it.  By the time I was half through it I just wanted it to be over.  I really should have just stopped and maybe come back to it at a later time.

Today I finished reading Book 1 of My Struggle by [Karl Ove Knausgaard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ove_Knausg%C3%A5rd).

I've been curious about this serious of books for quite some time, but admit to have avoided them because of the hype that had built up around them.  Recently I, for some reason, watched an interview with Karl Ove on YouTube and broke down and bought the first book.

I think the hype is deserved.  I'd say the first 30 pages or so are some of the most memorable text I've read in recent memory.  I've gone back and read the start of this book a few times now.  

There is so much that he recalled from his childhood that really touched me, and made me really start to dig up memories of my own that I had not thought of in quite some time.

I think I'm going to take a break and dig into some other things for a bit, but for certain I plan on finishing everything in this series.

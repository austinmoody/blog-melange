Today I finished reading *[The First Bad Man](http://www.amazon.com/The-First-Bad-Man-Novel/dp/1439172560)* by [Miranda July](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_July).  

It seems to be the hot hipster book of the moment and I gave in.

I was familiar with Miranda July mainly because of a couple of things:

* The movie *[Me And You And Everyone We Know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_and_You_and_Everyone_We_Know)* &larr; Didn't like it.
* The iOS App *[Somebody](http://somebodyapp.com)* &larr; Cool idea, poorly executed.

But this book was wonderful.  One of those books that I couldn't put down because I was dying to know what happened next.  Wonderfully kooky and well worth all the hipster praise.

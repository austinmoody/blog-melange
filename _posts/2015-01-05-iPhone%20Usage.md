A little over a week ago I installed the [Moment](https://inthemoment.io) app on my iPhone to get a handle on how much time I'm spending with my eyes stuck on that small rectangular screen. 

[When I installed the app](http://austinmoody.org/~melange/weekly/2015/01/04/Week%2520of%2520December%252029th/) I *guessed* that my usage would be about 40 hours a week. 

At the end of 7 days it turned out that I use my iPhone about 26.13 hours. So, not nearly as high as my guess. Initially that made me happy, but then when I thought about it I felt like 26 hours is still a long time. 

I suppose I can make myself feel somewhat better in that my phone really has taken the place of a laptop (mostly) for me. Outside of the laptop issued to me by my job I have MacBook from 2003 that is so old and slow that it is almost completely unusable. We also have a Chromebook but generally Becky is using it. Which leaves me with my phone. Besides the normal email, social media and general web browsing it acts as a magazine (I'm a pretty heavy Instapaper user), stereo (Spotify through Bluetooth speakers), and a notepad. Also, almost all of this blog has been set and written from my phone.

For now I've removed the app because it is brutal on battery life. But I plan on giving it another go sometime in the future to see if things change.

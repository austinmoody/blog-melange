Today I finished reading *[Waking Up](http://www.samharris.org/waking-up)* by [Sam Harris](http://www.samharris.org/). I had stumbled across Sam Harris some time ago when researching meditation and mindfulness and have read a few of his blog posts online.

Some people may know him as the guest on *Real Time with Bill Maher* when [Ben Affleck lost his shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60).

The argument of this book is that there is room and need for people to have spirituality outside of the framework of religion. Trust me this guy has no patience for religion whatsoever. This is more a discussion of consciousness and self-transcendence you can pursue that has nothing to do with any organized religion.

I enjoyed it.  I guess I wouldn't suggest it if you have a religion that you hold close because this book is going to do nothing but piss you off.

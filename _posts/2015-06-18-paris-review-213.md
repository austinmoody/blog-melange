Today I finished reading [The Paris Review &#35;213](http://www.theparisreview.org/back-issues/213). Well mostly reading. I skip past most of the poetry because I just (usually) don't *get* poetry.

I really liked the stories by [Lucia Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_Berlin), [Andres Neuman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Neuman), [David Szalay](http://literature.britishcouncil.org/david-szalay), and [Deb Olin Unferth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_Olin_Unferth).

There was a translation from the controversial new [Michel Houellebecq](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Michel_Houellebecq) novel that I enjoyed as well.

One evening about three years ago I was sitting at home paying bills online when I started getting some alarming emails. 

The first was a request to reset my Twitter password. You know, one of those emails you recieve when you initiate a password reset. This first email was not alarming in and of itself because I was used to getting those, quite often actually. 

Back at this time my Twitter handle was **@austin** and there were several other guys named Austin out there drooling over it not to mention various businesses in Austin, Texas. Every week I would get an email from some asking if I would be willing to part with it. These requests ranged from the hilarious *"Hey give me you Twitter name! LOL"* to *"I'm a struggling musician named Austin and having your Twitter name would help."* to people wanting to buy it. Curiously no one ever took me up on my price of $100,000 (yes I would have totally sold it for that price). 

So the Twitter password email didn't set off any bells and whistles, but the next few did as they alerted me to changes in my Google Voice settings and that my Twitter password had actually been changed. 

I can only think that I was lucky that I was up actively using my mail account, otherwise I don't have a clue where things would have ended up because it became obvious that I was not the only person using my email at that point. 

Freaking out I immediately changed my email password since I had that page open in a tab and was able to get into Google Voice to see what had happened there. 

Soon after this I noticed that there were multiple Twitter password request emails in my inbox. Several that I assume this person requested while they were able to access my mail. 

I had a sinking feeling, and a hunch as to what had happened, and sure enough I could no longer login to Twitter with my credentials. 

When I brought up the Twitter url for my (now stolen) handle this was what I saw:

Yes, those *were* my tweets.  No, that Hitler avatar was *not* mine.  Also my name is Austin but my last name is not Decker. 

Immediately I put a support ticket in with Twitter and for hours refreshed my (now stolen) Twitter page as I waited on a response. With nearly every refresh something changed. **My** tweets slowly started disappearing. The bio changed, several times. The avatar was changed away from Hitler and to some generic looking white guy.

Finally after a while all of my tweets were completely gone, and whoever it was started posting their own. Many boasting *"Got a new Twitter :)"*

Pretty much I felt a mix of anger and violation. I'm not famous and didn't have any strong personal brand that relied on that Twitter handle. But I had these creepy feeling of being violated.  That really is about the only way I can describe it. 

In the end the support ticket to Twitter was useless. After this *person* logged into my account they changed the email address and phone number associated with the account. So the only thing I had to prove that the account was really mine are the images you see linked above.  Needless to say his wasn't enough to convince the people at Twitter to help me out. 

Two factor authentication was not an option back then on Twitter. Hopefully if you somehow have found yourself reading this you already know to turn that on. 

However, as I was typing this I started trying to remember if two factor authentication was available from my email provider at that time.  I *think* that it may have been, but I just had not taken the time to set it up. Which makes me feel sick all over again. 

That night I barely slept I was so worked up about it. I emailed some friends about what had happened and the group of us started some amateur sleuthing. For a bit we just thought it was the work of some punk ass high school kid. We all actually joked about finding out his home number and calling his mom. 

After a while though we backed off because *whoever* it was interacting with members of the [UG Nazi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ug_nazi) hacker group.  Yes... we just stopped in our tracks. 

In the end it does not matter in the grand scheme of things. I created a new account, followed the people I gave a rip about. Life goes on.

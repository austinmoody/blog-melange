Today I finished reading *The Road To Character* by David Brooks.  I'm very surprised that I actually read this book.  Mainly because David Brooks generally rubs me the wrong way in his editorials (He is one of the *conservative* pundits who writes for the New York Times).  But I heard a couple of interviews with him about this book and became interested in the character studies that the book was described to contain.  

I *love* character studies.  I *love* to read about people and what makes them tick.  And in that regard this was a really good book.  The intention I think was to use those character studies to provide and enforce some kind of moral or *how to live a better life* story.  That was lost on me.

Today I finished reading [Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years Of Pilgrimage](http://www.harukimurakami.com/book/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki-and-his-years-of-pilgrimage) by [Haruki Murakami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami).  And it was beautiful.   I felt like I was flying between despair for the main character and hope for him. Not sure I got any resolution, still thinking about it, but I'm totally ok with it.

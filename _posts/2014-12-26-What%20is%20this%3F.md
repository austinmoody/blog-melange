Mélange - In French that means "mixture" (I think, maybe I should look that up)

Rolling towards the end of the year I just felt like *blogging* again. Whatever that means now.  I've had various sites online since the late 1990's, most all of which are now long gone. (Maybe I should check the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)?)

I think what really got me thinking about this was [Paul Ford](https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf)'s [tilde.club](http://tilde.club) that started up this year (sadly I did not get an account).  That site and the sites it has spawned reminded me of what blogging looked like back when I first got interested. These were the days when [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) was operated by a few people in San Francisco and not a part of Google.  Or if you were cool you installed Greymatter. So those days before Wordpress (or Movable Type even), Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc... 

At times over the past few years I had been a heavy Tumbr user. At one time I had a good many followers and followed back many of those folks. In a fit of rage one night I deleted my account mainly because someone was trying to get in to take my URL (I used to be [austin.tumblr.com](http://austin.tumblr.com)). I had already been through a mess not too long before when someone hacked me to get my Twitter username (I formally had [@austin](http://twitter.com/austin)) and just didn't feel like dealing with it.  It was the fear of another hack, but also I was just disillusioned with it. Posting was no longer linking up something I thought was interesting or re-blogging something and throwing on my two cents just because I wanted to. Instead I had started posting things that I knew would get a reaction out of the followers. Also there was some censorship creeping in as well as I started to realize there were some locals who had started following me. 

So there began a fresh start on Tumblr, and I never recovered. I couldn't really remember the usernames of most of the people I found most interesting, and they never found me. 

Now I've just setup this site as a way to *just post* stuff. I've got some ideas of standard things I'd like to post weekly or monthly, but I'm trying to not hold myself to any schedule. I guess I'll just see where it goes, and how long it lasts. 

So why the name... Mélange?  No cool reason unfortunately. Saw that word on a bag of salad greens the other night at the store + I have been feeling a little mixed up lately.

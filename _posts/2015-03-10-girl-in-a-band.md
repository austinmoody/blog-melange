Today I finished reading *[Girl In A Band](http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Band-Memoir-Kim-Gordon/dp/0062295896)* by [Kim Gordon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Gordon).  

I had been looking forward to the release of this memoir for quite a while.  And as excited as I was to get my hands on it I'm not really sure what I was looking for from it.  My socks weren't knocked off.  It wasn't bad, but I just felt like something was missing.  

That said, a totally interesting read if you are fan of Sonic Youth (I am).

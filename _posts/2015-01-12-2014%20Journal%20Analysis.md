**Regressive Imagery Dictionary** &rarr; *The English Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) is composed of about 3200 words and roots assigned to 29 categories of primary process cognition, 7 categories of secondary process cognition, and 7 categories of emotions[^fn1]*.

For a while I've been interested in ways to analyze text for information, particularly for things like mood.  I was first turned on to the Regressive Imagery Dictionary by [750Words] [1], a daily writing application that I used for a while many years ago and have always wanted to play around with it.

Recently, in my spare time, I've been using it against checkin comments for code at work.  Mainly just trying to see if I can determine the grumpiest and the happiest person on my team.  

But I figured I'd turn it on myself and see how things looked for me.  I've always been someone who kept a journal, mainly because I feel like it is a good exercise in clearing my head.  Over 2014 I was *generally* pretty good at it, writing several hundred words at least a couple times a week (sometimes more).  So, below you will find the RID analysis of my 2014 journal.

## Emotions 

![2014 Journal Emotions](http://austinmoody.org/i/melange_2014journal_2015-01-03-151758.png)

Mostly I was interested in the Emotion category, and I have to be honest that I was a little surprised that *Affection* was the highest.  Knowing my mood over the last year I figured that it would be Anxiety or Sadness.  I'm not sure, yet, if I should feel better that I'm not as bummed as I thought I was... or if maybe the RID doesn't *understand* me.

## How?

To get this data I started with some Ruby code that you can track down [here](http://matt.blogs.it/entries/00002563.html), with some minor tweaks.

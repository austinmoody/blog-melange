Yesterday someone I follow on Twitter posted a link to a link on The Toast to [Books That Literally All White Men Own](http://the-toast.net/2015/05/12/books-that-literally-all-white-men-own/).  I'm a white man, so of course I took a look.  Here are those from that list that I have at least read:

* *Slaughterhouse-Five* &rarr; Kurt Vonnegut
* *A Confederacy of Dunces* &rarr; John Kennedy Toole
* *Infinite Jest* &rarr; David Foster Wallace
* *A Farewell to Arms* &rarr; Ernest Hemingway
* *God Is Not Great* &rarr; Christopher Hitchens
* *Catch-22* &rarr; Joseph Heller
* *The Catcher in the Rye* &rarr; J.D. Salinger
* *The Great Gatsby* &rarr; F. Scott Fitzgerald
* *Lolita* &rarr; Vladimir Nabokov
* *The Da Vinci Code* &rarr; Dan Brown
* *The Grapes of Wrath* &rarr; John Steinbeck
* *The Tipping Point* &rarr; Malcolm Gladwell
* *Freakonomics* &rarr; Steven D. Levitt
* *Burr* &rarr; Gore Vidal
* *Into Thin Air* &rarr; Jon Krakauer
* *Into the Wild* &rarr; Jon Krakauer
* *On the Road* &rarr; Jack Kerouac
* *Lord of the Flies* &rarr; William Golding

So 18 out of 79.  Does that make me only 22.78% white male?  Am I supposed to be embarrassed that I haven't read more of these?  Am I supposed to be ashamed that *I have* read enough of these to be 22.78% white male? I don't get it.  

I hate lists like this. In general I'm a fan of what The Toast is about but this is silly.

I guess I am ashamed that I have read *The Da Vinci Code*, or maybe not.  It was entertaining.

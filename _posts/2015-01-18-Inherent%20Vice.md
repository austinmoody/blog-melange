Last night we drove to Asheville to see [Inherent Vice](http://is.gd/yuLYZY), because there is probably no way it will ever play in our town.

This, I believe, marks the first time that I was actually excited to spend money to go see a movie that quite possibly was going to suck. 

To date I have loved every movie that [Paul Thomas Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson) has made. *[There Will Be Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Will_Be_Blood)* has to be in my Top 5 list somewhere of favorite films ever. I'm pretty sure one night Becky and I watched *There Will Be Blood* twice right in a row and I didn't hate myself for it. 

So the guy writing the screenplay and directing the film comes with a background which should mean that I would be walking into this film assuming I would love it.

Then comes the source material, the novel *[Inherent Vice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_Vice)* by [Thomas Pynchon](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon) the famously reclusive novelist. I "read" Inherent Vice a couple years ago and I put read in quotes because I've only had my eyes pass over the words of those 360 or so pages once.  It takes a better person than I to read a Pynchon book one time and make sense of it. My eyes glazed over somewhere around when Doc goes to Las Vegas and I never really recovered. I wanted to attempt to read the book again before seeing the movie but honestly didn't feel up to it. Instead I read *[The Crying of Lot 49](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49)* again to get my head into that Pynchon-space.  1) because it is much shorter and 2) I could not locate my copy of *Inherent Vice* and was too cheap/lazy to go buy it again.   Am I a Pynchon fan? I'm not sure. His books, for me at least, require an amount of attention that I'm not sure I'm willing or able to provide. I do love *The Crying of Lot 49* and I'm always drawn very powerfully to writers with odd personas sometimes in spite of their work (example: [JD Salinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Salinger)... eternally interesting to me, but I just never liked *[The Catcher in the Rye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Catcher_in_the_Rye)*).

All this to say that when someone is going to make a movie of a Pynchon novel I am immediately intrigued. Pair that with the person making the movie being Paul Thomas Anderson and, well just go ahead and take my money. 

So, why did I walk into this movie assuming it was going to suck?  Simply because I just did not understand how someone could translate something as difficult and murky as a Pynchon novel into a movie. Not even Anderson, who I feel is know for difficult and murky movies. 

So how was it?

Well it's dense and all over the place and hard to follow. Drugs, sex, and weirdos everywhere. Paul Thomas Anderson certainly didn't try to dumb it down. 

It is exactly how I imagined a movie about a Pynchon novel would be. 

Just not sure how I feel about it, maybe in the end it is a valiant effort but a failed experiment?

I can totally understand how some people will watch this movie and easily label it as the worst movie Anderson has ever made. Especially coming off of *There Will Be Blood* and *The Master*.  But I don't really think that is fair because in the end I think he attempted to faithfully make a movie based on a book by an author whose books should not be turned into movies. 

As soon as it is available outside theaters I'm going to watch it again. I feel like I have to.

Today I finished reading *[Without You, There Is No Us](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20685373-without-you-there-is-no-us)* by [Suki Kim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suki_Kim).

I admit that I am a bit obsessed with North Korea so this book was right up my alley.  Totally recommended if you are even remotely interested in North Korea.

For my [2014 Journal Analysis post](http://austinmoody.org/~melange/journal/2015/01/12/2014%2520Journal%2520Analysis/) I utilized a [Rubygem](https://rubygems.org/) called [RIMA](https://rubygems.org/gems/RIMA) to aid in the Regressive Imagery Dictionary analysis.  On my local machine I was running version 1.9.3 of [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org)[^fn1] and initially would get the following error when attempting to process text:

<pre>
Error for line:     		ABSINTH (1)
/Users/austin/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551/gems/RIMA-1.0.0/lib/rima/stree.rb:31:in `key': undefined method `-' for "a":String (NoMethodError)
</pre>

From what I can tell this is being caused by a change in Ruby after version 1.8.

In Ruby 1.8 just calling the index of a string would return the integer representation of the character.  So, for example:

{% highlight ruby %}
irb(main):001:0> chr = 'a'
=> "a"
irb(main):002:0> chr[0]
=> 97
{% endhighlight %}

Now, if you do this same thing starting with Ruby 1.9 you get something different:

{% highlight ruby %}
irb(main):001:0> chr = 'a'
=> "a"
irb(main):002:0> chr[0]
=> "a"
{% endhighlight %}

The error is being caused by this line in the stree.rb file which is part of the RIMA Gem:

{% highlight ruby %}
rval = chr.downcase[0] - OFFSET + 2
{% endhighlight %}

The OFFSET variable is set earlier in the same file as:

{% highlight ruby %}
OFFSET = 'a'[0].freeze
{% endhighlight %}

In Ruby 1.8 this ends up being *97*, however in Ruby 1.9 this is set to just _a_.  

So in Ruby 1.9 and beyond the error is being caused because we are trying to subtract two strings (a - a) and an integer (2).  

To get the integer representation in Ruby 1.9 we need to use *getbyte*. 

So, a quick fix is for you to edit the stree.rb file that is part of the Gem library[^fn2].

The error that pops back to you will give you the file and line number:

<pre>/Users/austin/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p551/gems/RIMA-1.0.0/lib/rima/stree.rb:31</pre>

You will want to edit that file, and there are two lines that need to be changed.

At around line 3 you will need to change:

{% highlight ruby %}
OFFSET = 'a'[0].freeze
{% endhighlight %}

to 

{% highlight ruby %}
OFFSET = 'a'.getbyte(0).freeze
{% endhighlight %}

Then at around line 31 you will need to change:

{% highlight ruby %}
rval = chr.downcase[0] - OFFSET + 2
{% endhighlight %}

This line you will need to change to:

{% highlight ruby %}
rval = chr.downcase.getbyte(0) - OFFSET + 2
{% endhighlight %}

Once that is saved, you should be able to use the Gem normally on your machine with > 1.8 Ruby and it will work.

[^fn1]: I'm now using 2.1.5, but the problem exists there as well of course.
[^fn2]: Will probably try to contact the auther the Gem to see about an update, I just wanted to get it working on my machine quick and made these notes.

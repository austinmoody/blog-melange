As a follow up to [Books That Literally All White Men Own?](http://austinmoody.org/~melange/books/2015/05/13/whitemenbooks/) we now have a list of books that were found in Osama Bin Laden's compound when he was killed.  You can see that list here: [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/20/chomsky-woodward-and-911-conspiracy-theories-bin-ladens-english-language-bookshelf/](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/20/chomsky-woodward-and-911-conspiracy-theories-bin-ladens-english-language-bookshelf/).

I'm happy to report that I have read exactly 0 of the books on the list, making me obviously 0% terrorist.

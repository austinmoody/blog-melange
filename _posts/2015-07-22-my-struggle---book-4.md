![Karl Ove Knausgaard - My Struggle - Book 4](http://austinmoody.org/i/melange_karlovebook4_2015-07-23-174135.png)

At this point I'm all caught up on Karl Ove's *Struggle*.  The english translations at least.  I'm still amazed somewhat that these books draw me in they way that they do.  Another 450 page book with no chapter breaks.  Another 450 page book that feels like a stream of consciousness recollection of a guy's life.  Can't stop, won't stop however.

I found [Book 4](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/books/review/jeffrey-eugenides-reviews-my-struggle-by-karl-ove-knausgaard.html?_r=0) more engaging than Book 3, but in a way that I can't really explain.  I guess his teenage obsession with girls and getting laid is something anyone can relate to.

This one ends with him losing his virginity to a frumpy girl in a tent at a music festival.  So I guess Karl Ove and I do have something in common after all.

![The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway](http://austinmoody.org/i/melange_thesun_2015-05-16-130900.png)

Once a year as the weather starts to get hot I read this book.  Have for a few years in a row now.  Not really sure what it is about the weather getting hot that makes me want to read it.  

I love it.  If I were forced to pick a favorite book I'm pretty sure this would be it.  Bumps and all it is beautiful

Today I finished reading (again) The Stranger by [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus).

This is one of those books that I never get tired of.  My paperback copy is getting quite dirty and worn.  This time I read it in preparation to read [The Meursault Investigation](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/books/review/the-meursault-investigation-by-kamel-daoud.html), which is a retelling of The Stranger from the side of the brother of the mysterious *arab* that gets murdered on the beach.  

I still love this book, something different jumps out at me every time I read it.

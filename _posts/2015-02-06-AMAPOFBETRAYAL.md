Today I finished reading *[A Map of Betrayal](http://www.amazon.com/A-Map-Betrayal-Novel/dp/0307911608)* by [Ha Jin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ha_Jin).  Initially I became interested in this book because it was a *spy* story and I love spy stories.  This is a story about a spy, but it is more a story about family and inner struggle.  I loved it.  This was the first book I've read by Ha Jin, but will for sure be checking out more.

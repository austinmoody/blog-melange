[Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest) by [David Foster Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace).

It took me two months to read this book again.  I honestly don't remember how long it took me several years back on the first try.  It took so long partially because I really was careful this time to lookup words that I had no idea of, and to try and build a map of characters.  

I find this book frustrating to say the least.  I mean it **is** a great book, there is much to love.  The descriptions of being trapped in depression is some of the most gripping stuff I've ever read.  But there is a lot of it that just gets under my skin as well.  I find a good bit of the racism in the book hard to take.  

Initially I had started reading this book again because of the release of the [End of Tour](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3416744/) film.  I wanted to have D.F.W. fresh in my mind to see it.  Since then, however, I've decided not to see the film because his literary estate was not approached about the film and vehemently oppose it.

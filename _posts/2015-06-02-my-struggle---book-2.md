![My Struggle - Book 2](http://austinmoody.org/i/melange_mystrugglebook2_2015-06-02-150452.png)

This book didn't grip me as tight as [Book 1](http://austinmoody.org/~melange/books/2015/04/22/my-struggle---book-1-by-karl-ove-knausgaard/) did but I was still hooked.  Another seemingly ramble of a book about a guy's life with no chapter breaks.  But it works, very well indeed.  I've already purchased Book 3 and Book 4 and can't wait to dive into those as well.
